        We know parents and carers are often short on time, so weâ€™ve gathered a
        collection of tried-and-tested ideas that are always a hit. Each one
        comes with a simple recipe you can count on. Just click a tile for a
        quick overview, then follow the link to dive into the full recipe.

      <p>Happy baking! ðŸŽ‰</p>
